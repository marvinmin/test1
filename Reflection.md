### Reflection

Our dashboard does well in answering our research questions of understanding unemployment rates across industries over a range of years. It also allows the user to interact with the plots in various ways with a radio button, year slider and multi-option select tabs using the many features that dash has to offer. Our dashboard is simple, yet effective, especially when we divided the graphs into 3 tabs. This allows the user to focus on one plot at a time and to gain insight with the single graph. Even with the limited amount of data we were able to display two different types of statistics in unemployment rates. 

Due to time constraints and the extent of our knowledge, there were a couple of known limitations:
- Our year range slider for our plots cannot be restricted so that the same year is chosen for the range. This creates single points on the graph that holds no significance for the user to see.
- The changes to the slider are quite static, we hope for the future to improve the smooth transition when we use the slider to select different ranges. 

We also would have liked to add more features on our app that allow deeper interactions of the plots that allow users to understand the trends more clearly. For example, a detailed tooltip that could tell us more information about the countryâ€™s industry, but we were limited with the lack of knowledge on what country this dataset was from.
- We used the Github issues to create a to-do list that let us communicate with each other the tasks at hand and made sure we were following our timeline and team contract.
